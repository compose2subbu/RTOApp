<h1 ><a name="Basic Rules of the Road">Basic Rules of the Road </a></h1>

<P>The rules enlisted under this category are to be meant for all the people sharing the roads. 
The idea behind formulating such rules is that the roads are meant not only for the drivers (including motorists/cyclists/motorcyclists), 
but are shared by the pedestrians and animals by the road side. The rules belonging to these categories are mandatory to be followed while using the roads. 
You can observe all the above-stated rules only if you are patient, considerate and careful.

<p> Traffic rules of the roads are both the laws and the informal rules that may have been developed over time to facilitate the orderly and timely flow of traffic. 
With the replacement of ancient horse driven carts with cars and trucks, the speed of the traffic increased paving way for the need of smooth roads and yet smoother traffic. 
So, to curb the need of the smoother traffic, some rules were devised to assure that the traffic runs smooth. 
Almost all of the roadways traffic rules are built with devices meant to control traffic.
</P><br><br>
<br><br>
<p>The basic idea to devise rules is to make the traffic more organized. 
These establish a direct contact with the driver and help making the ride easy and controlled by delivering information which compliments the laws, guiding directions, speed limits and parking zones. 
All these efforts collectively assure that traffic is orderly and safe. An organized traffic has well established priorities, lanes flowing in particular directions.
 The benefit is that it reduces the travel time. Some rules and regulations have been formulated for an easy driving.
 The drivers are not allowed to drive without a few documents. 
 These documents should be produced on demand.
